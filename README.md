Did a basic EDA analysis on post data of an Instagram user. 
Used regression algorithm PassiveAggressiveRegressor() to predict reach of a post. 
PassiveAggressiveRegressor() is used when your model is being fed the data continuously and simultaneously it is updating its best fit line. So,
it falls under online learning in Machine Learning. In online learning, a machine learning model is trained and deployed in production so that 
it continues to learn as new data arrives.Thus, the passive aggressive strategy is perfect to use in problems where data is streaming in a continuous flow. 
Learnt something new in this one and half hour work. Any suggestions are always welcomed.
Thank you.
